# News Summary challenge

Week 7 - Weekend challenge at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/)

How to run
----

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `index.html`




Task
----

Your app will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

### Technologies

You'll write a single page web app.  You'll write your code in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML.  You won't use Ruby or backend JavaScript.

**And, as is the theme for this week, you won't use any libraries or frameworks!**


## User Stories

Some of these stories will need decomposing if they seem too large.
